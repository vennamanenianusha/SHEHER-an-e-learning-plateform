&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our project SHEHER is an e-learning platform for kids of age 6 – 11. As we know there are scenarios where parents as unable to send their kids especially young girls to schools, so we want to reach out to those and spread the knowledge. We not only provide academic education but also provide extra-curricular activities and also few games, so that it would bring out the creative side of the child. This is a free site so that everyone can afford and access. We believe that “You can’t build a great building on a weak foundation” so that the child would be strong from the beginning to face any hurdles in future. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We accept material from any one we would verify those materials before posting them on our site, anyone could contribute to share their knowledge by reaching out to us through our mail or any of our social media platform.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We also display the beautiful work of our students in our home page and also on our social media platforms so that we showcase and encourage them more.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Built the project with technologies like Angular, NodeJs, data base MongoDB for filtering we used algorithms of ML using python, Dialogflow for chat bot.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In our homepage we have soothing music to enhance the user’s mood, a small introduction, the benefits of SHEHER, our mission, one of the latest work of our students, comments and ratings received from the users, Frequently asked questions, information to reach out to us (social media platforms) and a friendly Chabot to chat with.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The access any of the content in the site the user should either be a registered one having his/her credentials to login or a new user yet to register to get his credentials.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If a new user is registering he/she should use a mail, username, password, phone number, grade, this page undergoes validation so that there would not be any duplicate entries under the same mail id and the password should be strong. For the first time after registering navigate to the main page where they can choose a category.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The main page consists of flash cards showing the 3 main categories which are Academics, Extracurricular, Game page. Clicking on any of the flash card would redirect to their respective next page. There is also an option to log out of the account which would redirect us to the login page.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Academics would route us to a grade page where all the grades and their topics would be displayed and clicking on the appropriate grade would redirect to that grade where we will be able to access the material available for that grade and attempt quiz of that grade.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Extracurricular would navigate us to a page where all the different activities would be available and could easily navigate within the same page and access the interested activity. There are wide varieties of activities to choose and learn on.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Game page could not be accessed without the accounts password, as kids would be willing to play rather than focus on other things not to invest more time on playing games we have provided the password entry so the parents have to enter the password and they will know what the kid is actually playing. The games which we have provided are those which would help the kid to improve her concentration and the logical working ability of her brain.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are so many women in their houses who are willing to contribute their knowledge to others, we encourage people like them to share their work so that this would bring light into many young kids life and might inspire them to choose a right path for themselves. As of now we are only providing for age limit up to 11 but we are willing to expand.<br>
